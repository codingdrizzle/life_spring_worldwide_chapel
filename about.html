                          We believe that the salvation of sinners is wholly of
                          God's grace through the work of God's son who took
                          upon himself our nature yet without sin and by his own
                          obedience even in death paid for our sins. He is the
                          risen Lord now living and pleading for us at God's
                          throne. He is the only saviour for men.

                          secure to those who believe in complete fellowship
                          with God. We are forgiven of sin, and made righteous
                          before God by our faith in our redeemer's blood (blood
                          of Christ), and brought into blessed peace and favour
                          with God. We have every blessing needful for time and

                          being saved except his own rejection of the Gospel.
                          His rejection of Christ condemns him to eternal
                          punishment.

                          spirit of God to make us new. We know our sinful
                          condition and turn to God, laying aside our sins and
                          receive the Lord Jesus Christ as our saviour, priest
                          and King. We lean upon him as the only and only all
                          sufficient saviour.

                          holy, just and good obedience to His holy law is

                          and Holy spirit. It is a picture of death to sin and

                          baptized believers can take part in it. However,
                          church members and visiting Baptists / other believers

                          purpose and giving ourselves to worship, service and
